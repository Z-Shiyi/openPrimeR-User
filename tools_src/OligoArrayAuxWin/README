OligoArrayAux is an auxilliary package designed for use with the OligoArray software.  The package consists of several C programs and Perl scripts for performing energy minimization calculations on nucleic acid sequences.  OligoArrayAux is a subset of the UNAFold package, which calculates partition functions as well as minimum energies for a full ensemble of species for one or two nucleic acid sequences.

The software is known to build and run properly on the following platforms:

Linux
FreeBSD
SGI IRIX
Sun Solaris
IBM AIX
MS Windows (with MinGW or Cygwin)
MacOSX 10.3

Building and installing the software should be as simple as typing ./configure, make and make install.  By default, the software is installed in /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/man and /usr/local/share, but this can easily be modified with the --prefix option of the configure script.  For example, ./configure --prefix=~ will install the software in the user's home directory.

On many systems, performance can be increased significantly if certain compiler flags are used.  For example, on a machine with an Intel Pentium III processor, type ./configure CFLAGS='-O3 -march=pentium3' to enable Pentium III-specific optimizations as well as architecture-independent optimizations.

The file INSTALL for more detailed information about the usage of the configure script.  In addition to the options described therein, the configure script for OligoArrayAux supports the following option:

--enable-force enables support for force constraints.  Force constraints are disabled by default, which causes the software to run faster.
